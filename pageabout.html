	<p>'Green Is The New Black' is a scheme, targeted at the younger generation of Manchester (aged 18-25) to encourage them to engage <br> and connect with nature and the natural world the same way they engage with social media and all the trends which come with it. <br> Mentioned prior, it is for the younger generation of people who live in the area of Manchester. This is because the generation nowadays are<br> addicted to social media and technology and this scheme is to get nature involved with themselves and the social media platforms that they use on a day-to-day basis. <br> <br> We are encouraging to get the younger generation to get out the house and to explore nature which is on their doorstep, whilst also getting the social media they love involved with it too. How may we do this? Well, they can go out and explore and take photographs of and with nature to post onto their accounts, with the best ones featuring here on our website.</p>
